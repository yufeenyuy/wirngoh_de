--createlogsandnumpy.py
In this python script i leaned how to create logs files in different ways. Log files are used to store different information
about the behavior of a code during execution. This can help to track errors and also analyse performance of a code.

--dataextraction.py
In this script i learned how to load data from sklearn datasets. Sklearn provides several datasets that can be used to learn 
data and analytics. 
I equally learned how to extract data from yelp. Yelp is a platform that advertises businesses and provide user-generated reviews for
these businesses. Yelp provide developers with APIs that allow them to querry their public database. This public database is accessible
via Yelp fussion or GraphQl. There is a comprehensive documentation to help you get started with Yelp fussion and GraphQl via the 
the following link: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/getting-started.
Yelp fussion API: REST API with several endpoints for querying the public database.
GraphQl:An efficient way to query the database as it offers the possibility to make several requests with a single query, unlike REST.
