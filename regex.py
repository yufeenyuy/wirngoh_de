Regular expressions: This offers a means to match characters based on a special expression.
Regular expression offer special characters that are used in expressions
Some of these characters and their meaning as well functions include:
re.search('regular expression', string to be search from): this function returns boolean values
re.findall('regular expression', string to be search from): this function returns a list.
A dot i.e . means match any characted e.g &$ยง,numbers, alphabets
A * means match 0...many characters and matche the longest possible part of the string.
A *? means match 0...many characters and matche the shortest possible part of the string.
A + means match 1...many characters and matche the longest possible part of the string.
A +? means match 1...many and match the shortest possible part of the string.
A \S means match non-blank character i.e white spaces are not matched.
A ^ means start matching at the beginning of a string
A [] matches what is defined in the bracket as a single character. e.g [adb] matches strings containing a d or b
A [^] matches everything except what is defined in the bracket. e.g [^adb] matches strings that don't contain a d or b. 
A () extracts exactly the characters defined in the paranthesis. ( for beginning of extraction and ) for end of extraction.
\ helps to take special characters like $ e.g \$ takes the $ sign.
